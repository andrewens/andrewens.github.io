## About

I made this in-game lua editor as part of a project to make game development more accessible to kids aged 7-14 by building video games that subtly teach you development skills. I unfortunately didn't have the time / energy to bring this to fruition, although I did make an equivalent version that's just for typing. (Typing is the #1 bottleneck preventing kids from learning coding -- they type at rates less than 10 words per minute.)
