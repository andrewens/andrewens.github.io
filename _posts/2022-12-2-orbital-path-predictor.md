## About

While playing with [n-body gravity simulations](./2022-12-8-n-body-simulation.md) for [Ship Crew RPG](./2023-6-29-ship-crew-rpg.md), I found it difficult to construct stable orbits -- so I prototyped a quick orbit calculator. It works by simply running 100 or so iterations into the future to predict the orbital path. It doesn't account for the movement of the large gravitational mass.

I haven't begun constructing large solar systems or galaxies yet for Ship Crew RPG, so this aspect of development is currently paused.
