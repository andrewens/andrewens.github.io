## About

This is the second iteration of Tunnel Wars. You can see the first iteration [here.]({% post_url 2023-1-2-tunnel-wars-v1 %})

Tunnel Wars V1 had a lot of user-experience issues with the controls feeling awkward, especially around the ladder mechanics. I spent a lot of time on the second iteration improving how it felt to move your character through the world -- including jumping off ladders, letting go of ladders, back-strafing, character's head point at the mouse, and so on.

The biggest core game loop change I made was adding a round-system, which my test audience really appreciated.

(I rewrote all of the code from V1 as well).

And as you can see, the map got simplified a lot as well. I also added some custom UI elements, but they weren't anything special.
