## About

I got sick of doing research for [Ship Crew RPG]({% post_url 2023-6-29-ship-crew-rpg %}) and I desperately wanted to put together a *game*. So I simplified a lot and decided to just remake the ROBLOX 2008 classic game, [The Underground War](https://www.roblox.com/games/189632/The-Underground-War) -- but in two dimensions, around a *round* planet. This is the result. 

Also, I added a volcano that eats blocks!

I did playtest this with players -- but I unfortunately forgot to record gameplay footage :/ 

*(I think I can add screenshots though... coming soon)*


## Gifs

IDK why there are no gifs of it, but the player also has a shotgun.
