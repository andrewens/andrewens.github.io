# About

Undead Defense was the first game published by my company, Starfall Studios, in 2019. The game combines a classic ROBLOX tycoon game with battle royale-style looting mechanics and waves of three different kinds of zombies. We ran ads in the summer of 2019 and got up to 225 concurrent players, but the game wasn't developed enough to retain those players so it died when the ads stopped. I considered developing a sandbox-style building system to replace the tycoon system, but at the time I was overworked and stressed out so I decided to pivot and make a simpler game. In retrospect, I should have taken a week off and then reassessed, because -- although I LOVE the game we made next -- Undead Defense would have been successful if I had taken the time to perfect the player retention. People loved the concept enough to get us to 30k visits overnight. 

# Gifs

I recorded these gifs recently. The gun recoil and "animation" mechanics were implemented using the 2019 ROBLOX physics constraints system. Recent updates to the ROBLOX physics engine have since broken my system.

There's also a plane that flies over the map and drops supply crates, but I don't have a gif of it. The crates parachute to the ground and then spawn the best weapons in the game.
