## About

I got sick of doing research for [Ship Crew RPG]({% post_url 2023-6-29-ship-crew-rpg %}) and I desperately wanted to put together a _game_. So I simplified a lot and decided to just remake the ROBLOX 2008 classic game, [The Underground War](https://www.roblox.com/games/189632/The-Underground-War) -- but in two dimensions, around a _round_ planet. This is the result.

Also, I added a volcano that eats blocks!

I did playtest this with players -- but I unfortunately forgot to record gameplay footage :/

_(I think I can add screenshots though... coming soon)_

## Gifs

IDK why there are no gifs of it, but the player also has a shotgun.
