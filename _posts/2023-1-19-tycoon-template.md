## About

We had an extra day before the [2023 ROBLOX Game Jam]({% post_url 2023-1-27-assimilation-tag %}), so I decided to do a "pre-jam" and make a tycoon system. The system interprets a folder directory system in ROBLOX studio and can then clone new tycoon instances as you wish. You don't have to worry about mass-editing a million ROBLOX script instances.
