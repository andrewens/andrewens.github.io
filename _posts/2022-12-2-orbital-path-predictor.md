## About

While playing with [n-body gravity simulations]({% post_url 2022-12-8-n-body-simulation %}) for [Ship Crew RPG]({% post_url 2023-6-29-ship-crew-rpg %}), I found it difficult to construct stable orbits -- so I prototyped a quick orbit calculator. It works by simply running 100 or so iterations into the future to predict the orbital path. It doesn't account for the movement of the large gravitational mass.

I haven't begun constructing large solar systems or galaxies yet for Ship Crew RPG, so this aspect of development is currently paused.

> *This post is still a work in progress! I'll add more soon :)*
