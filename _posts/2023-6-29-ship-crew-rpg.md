## About

_(RPG = Roleplaying Game -- similar to Skyrim or any game with quests )_

I am currently working on this game.

**The concept**: you are a crewmember on a sci-fi spaceship, and you must complete missions.

(The long-term goal is for the universe to be filled with political factions like governments, criminals, industrial guilds, aliens, and so on, so players will have to choose who to serve when they take missions.)

**Where I'm at**: I've successfully tested the gameplay, and people really liked it! It seems that no one has ever made a team-based sandbox/RPG game quite like this one before.

I have a [roadmap](https://github.com/users/andrewens/projects/4/views/1) on github and am working toward the first milestone, which is controlling a character that can interact with the world.

## Gifs

Unforuntately, the only gameplay footage I recorded was the bugs :(

(sometimes, in the proof of concept, you jump too high)

(and the rendering breaks if someone dies inside of the ship)

All of the remaining gifs are from development, in ROBLOX Studio.
